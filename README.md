# unetsockets
UnetSockets for all!

UnetSockets is a collection of simple and easy to use libraries for connecting to instances of [UnetStack](https://unetstack.net/). This could be either UnetStack running inside a simulation, or on actual hardware.

UnetSockets provide a familiar socket-style API for communicating over Unets, and some convenience functions for common tasks.

UnetSockets build on top of the [fj√•ge Gateways](https://github.com/org-arl/fjage/tree/master/gateways), which implement the low level distributed agent framework used by UnetStack in the respective languages.

- [C](c/README.md)
